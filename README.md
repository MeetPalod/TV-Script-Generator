# Generate-TV-Script-Using-RNN
Generated new TV scripts for Seinfeld using RNNs by training the model on Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons.  The Neural Network generated a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## About Seinfeld
[Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld) is an American sitcom television series created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld for NBC. As a comedian rising in popularity in the late 1980s, Seinfeld was presented with an opportunity to create a show with NBC.
